CS257 Database Project - Part 1
Author: Kunal Elchipuram

COMPILATION (in Docker GCC container):
  gcc -g -o db db.cpp

//since i was testing the code before submission on mac - i had to specifically 
mention to use the c++ standard library otherwise , gcc on mac gets confused with clang

Note: If compiling on Mac/local system, use:
  gcc -g -o db db.cpp -lstdc++
  OR
  g++ -g -o db db.cpp

EXECUTION:
  ./db "SQL_COMMAND"

EXAMPLES:
  ./db "create table student (id int, first char(10), last varchar(10), age int)"
  ./db "insert into student values (1, 'John', 'Doe', 20)"
  ./db "select * from student"
