so the tokenizer is used to indentify the commands entered into the CLP, and then construct out a linked list with these commands?

the table descriptor , is a struct that contains the metadata of the table, i.e the name, number of columns etc

similarly a struct that contains details of the column 

didnt quite understand the use of the header for the tpd? what is its purpose? what do you mean by using the dbbin to serialize the db

the cpp code
starts off with the main program that calls the tokenizer to start off with 
then pass to semantic analyzer
